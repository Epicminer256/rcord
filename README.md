# rcord (Outdated, use Glasscord)
A python discord bot for signing up for classes (Designed for student logins only)

## Quick start

To clone the repository (you need recursive for RethinkAPI): `git clone --recursive https://github.com/EpicMiner256/rcord`

To install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run: `python main.py`

Once ran, it will generate a config. It will ask for a bot token, how long the bot's messages stay up for, and the Rethink URL. Ctrl+C will save your data and quit the server
